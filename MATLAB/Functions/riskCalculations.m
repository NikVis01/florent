% RISKCALCULATIONS Legacy file - functions have been moved to separate files
%
% This file previously contained multiple functions. They have been split into
% separate files for better MATLAB compatibility:
%
%   - calculate_influence_score.m
%   - calculate_topological_risk.m
%   - calculate_weighted_alignment.m
%   - sigmoid.m
%
% All functions are now directly callable. This file is kept for reference
% but is no longer used.

% Empty file - functions moved to separate files
