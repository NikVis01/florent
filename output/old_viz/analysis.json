Therefore, a high importance score of 0.9 is justified as the success of financing activities and overall project execution largely hinges on robust compliance management.\n\nAs for the influence score, it is rated at 0.7. Nexus Global Infrastructure has significant capabilities in strategic financing and logistics, which gives the firm a decent level of control over compliance aspects. However, the dependence on external legal and regulatory consultants means that the firm may not exert complete influence over compliance outcomes. The firm's experience within the energy and construction sectors offers a good understanding of compliance nuances, but it is still subject to the varying nature of different regulatory bodies and geopolitical factors. Therefore, while Nexus can actively manage and navigate compliance effectively, an influence score of 0.7 reflects the partially external nature of compliance enforcement.",
